   <p> The rose is a type of flowering shrub. Its name comes from the Latin word Rosa.[1] The flowers of the rose grow in many different colors, from the well-known red rose or yellow roses and sometimes white or purple roses. Roses belong to the family of plants called Rosaceae. All roses were originally wild and they come from several parts of the world, North America, Europe, northwest Africa and many parts of Asia and Oceania. There are over 100 different species of roses. The wild rose species can be grown in gardens, but most garden roses are cultivars, which have been chosen by people.[2]

Over hundreds of years they have been specially bred to produce a wide variety of growing habits and a broad range of colours from dark red to white including as well yellow and a bluish/lilac colour. Many roses have a strong, pleasant scent. Most roses have prickles (incorrectly called thorns) on their stems. Rose bushes are able to tolerate a wide variety of growing conditions. The fruit of the rose is called a hip. Some roses have decorative hips.

Roses are widely used across the world as symbols of love, sympathy or sorrow.

Rose is widely used as a girl's name. Also, roses protect themselves from other predators trying to hunt them with thorns, a widely known defense system.</p>
<marquee><l>BENIFITS OF FLOWER</l></marquee>
<P> Most people enjoy flowers in any way, shape, or form they can get them. Aside from being pretty, plants have many benefits for a person’s overall health and well-being. Summer is a great time for change, so why not spruce up for house or office with a few more plants. Here are just a few health benefits of having fresh-cut flowers part of your everyday life:

 

Emotional Health Improvement
Receiving flowers, whether they are sent from another person or you bought them for yourself, can give you an immediate mood boost. A bouquet of flowers is a sign that someone cares for you, and being well-thought of can do a lot for a person’s well-being. A pretty flower bouquet with bright colors and a soothing scent can brighten a room and your mood at the same time.

 

Aid in Memory and Concentration
Many people have a moment where they completely lose their train of thought. Keeping plants in indoor spaces may help with concentration and memory; plants oxygenate the air, boosting your brain cells and making you feel more like your best self. You can opt for a bouquet, or go for a longer-lasting plant, such as Teleflora’s Peaceful Zen Garden, a combination of bamboo and easy-to-care-for succulents in a brown bamboo container. These plants only need water once a week and grow quickly, making them entertaining, as well as good for supercharging your brain.</P>
